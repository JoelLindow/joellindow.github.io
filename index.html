							<p>I'm a father of 3 (soon to be 4) and a proud husband. I've done many things over the years including general contracting, international technical products procurement, pricing negotiation, audio production and much more. I've lead a very diverse life. I've had the opportunity to work with people from every level of education, social status, income range, religionus background, ethnic background and technical ability. I have a lot left to learn in life but have already partaken in many rich and enlightening experiences that have made me who I am.</p>

							<p>I am currently pursuing an objective that is 100% outside my area of comfort. I am undergoing a rapid education in software and web development. This is a complete immersion in multiple software languages and a gauntlet of projects and challenges that demand I learn at a very quick pace. It is truly one of the biggest challenges I've ever put my brain through. It hurts! But with the pain comes intense growth. I am truly exhausted but I am also intensely grateful and excited for the opportunity to learn something relevant and new while I'm still in my 30's.</p>

							<p>My professional career has been about working with people that take pride in their product, their customers, their processes and each other. I've always craved the opportunity to conquer unique challenges, coach efficient process, bridge departmental gaps, mentor others and bring the highest level of service, Integrity  and professionalism to my work team. Each day is a new learning experience which I crave to truly capitalize on.</p>

							<p>I believe in the power of individuals and the unlimited potential a good team can have. I also believe that a client can be a better customer when served by a company made up of individuals who genuinely care and coach an easy and efficient process. I desire to bring my trade skills, business experience, coaching experience, customer experience skills and outgoing personality to the table.  Being quick to forgive and slow to blame are all highly important in my daily activities. I always desire to see others succeed and learn. I desire to see my team and customers  filled with confidence and pride in their daily accomplishments.</p>

							<p>In my experience the greatest reward comes from not just reaching the finish line but more so in seeing individuals grow stronger during the journey. We all win together. I look forward to learning how you and  I can find ways to succeed together as well. Please feel free to reach out and make contact if you desire. I'd be excited to hear from you.
 							</p>
