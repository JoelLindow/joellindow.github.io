				<h2>18 weeks later!</h2>
				<hr noshade>
				<p>So, I'm not a full time developer yet. In fact, it feels like it may never happen. But... everything seems harder when you're in the middle of a battle.</p>

				<p>I've been well versed in basic ruby at this point. In fact I've experienced so much more! Now I've Used the following amazing tools, concepts, frameworks and mixins many many times:</p>

				<p>- Rails</p>
				<p>- Active Record</p>
				<p>- RSpec</p>
				<p>- MiniTest</p>
				<p>- Capybara</p>
				<p>- SQL /SQLite3</p>
				<p>- Basic Ruby</p>
				<p>- Authentication / Authorization</p>
				<p>- Building Shopping Carts</p>
				<p>- Bootstrap / Materialize</p>
				<p>- HTML with embedded Ruby Code</p>
				<p>- CSS styling</p>
				<p>- SO MUCH MORE...</p>

				<p>Although I've been exposed to so much and had chances to use it, I find that a lot of these things are still areas I need to revisit to really lock in my learning. I've found that I truly learn differently from others. As I like to say, "If I don't understand all of it I don't uderstand any of it".</p>

				<p>At this point I've met great people. I've spent countless hours focusing not only on my own growth but on the growth of others. I've honestly been putting in around 70 hours into my learning every single week. And, you know what... it's paying off. I can not develop web applications. I can use Test Driven Development to get results I'm looking for. I'm finally starting to understand where to find useful resources on the web when  Ineed more information on subject matter. ANd, for once, I'm really starting to see that this is another amazing set of skills I can add to my "toolbag of life" and use to build a meaningful future for myself and my family.</p>

				<p>At this point I'm seeing how valuable all this knowledge is. I hope that once I depart from Turing that  Ican build a weekend program for kids who might be getting out of high school with no sense of drection. Perhaps passing on the first few bits of knowledge of coding to them will allow them to find a path in life and give them the desire to learn more.</p>

				<p>It's been a crazy ride, and it's not over yet! Full steam ahead!</p>
