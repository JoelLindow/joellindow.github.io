				<h2>My First Blog: 6 weeks of pain!</h2>
				<hr noshade>
				<p>Many of us have heard the statement, "If it doesn't hurt, you're not growing". If that statement is true, I must be growing by leaps and bounds. Just 6 weeks or so ago I began my education at the Turing School of Software and Design. I had successfully passed the interviewing process and was ready to dive into learning my first computer language. Ruby! Sur, I had done so goofing around in Q-Basic, C++ and a few HTML editors 20 years ago... but never to the point that I produced anything of value. At this point, I litterally knew less than nothing and I was very excited to get started. </p>

				<p>Throughout the first 6 weeks (Module 1) of the Back End program I have learned many new things. I've learned about basic things like <i>strings</i> and <i>integers</i>. I've learned about <i>loops, arrays, code blocks</i> and <i>enumerators/iterators</i>. I've learned about bigger concepts like <i>classes, initialize methods, instance variables, class objects, getter and setter methods</i> and <i>passing arguements</i>. I've learned a ton!</p>

				<p>Somehow magically I have learned enough to be considered a "passing student" of Module 1. This means I am worthy of continuing on to Module 2. How? I'm not sure. A lot of these concepts are still very new to me and I still feel very uncertain of how to use them proficiently. However, I am confident that over time and with deliberate practice I will be able to use these skills in an ever more meaningful way.</p>

				<p>Sure, I'm not writing big complex programs yet. Sure, I struggle with passing arguements and values between multiple classes and methods. Sure, I'm barely hanging on by the tips of my fingers. It's not easy, and nobody said it would be. In fact it's downright hard. But, when the going gets tough... the tough GET GOING! Although I have some very tough days of self hate, discouragement and self doubt... there are still small victories to celebrate. There are still small accomplishments that verify that I am indeed learning. There are moments that force me to look back just 6 short weeks and realize that I might not know everything but I sure have learned a ton in a short amount of time.</p>

				<p>I'm not "there" yet, but I'll get there. In the meantime I have to keep reminding myself that it's not about the destination as much as it is about the journey. Stay in the present. Focus on what I can learn and not what it is that I can't learn right now. It won't happen overnight! There will be failures. It will hurt. But if it hurts... I'm most likely learning something.</p>

				<p>Keep on coding! I'll see you next time!</p>
